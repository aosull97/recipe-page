## Overview

### The challenge
The challenge was to build a recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## My process
I first looked over the provided design brief to see what the finished product should look like. Then I added the basic structure with HTML, including any images that needed displaying. I then added styling with CSS until it looked as close to the design as possible.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

I learnt how to apply different styles for different media types/devices by using the CSS media rule. 

```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {
    body {
        margin-top: 8rem;
        background-color: hsl(30, 54%, 90%);
    }
}
```

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/atrule_media.php) - I referred to this documentation when I needed to learn how to use CSS properties that I wasn't as familiar with such as the media rule.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - I could find the font requested in the design brief here.
